# Artificial-Neural-Network---Prediction-of-rainfall-and-classification
Here we use the Radar Data and actuall ground based measurement of rainfall to develop and train our ANN. Later we make use of this to predict the rainfall from Radar Reflectivity data. We also classify the type of rain as Stratiform and Convective Rainfall using ANN. We also see how ANN fails to predict the Time Series Rainfall based on the past rainfall data, shortage of data being one of the main culprit.
